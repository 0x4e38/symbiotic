Building
======================================================================

Symbiotic must be built in another directory then the sources.
Baisacally, the usage is:

  symbiotic-build.sh make_options

An example:

$ git clone https://github.com/mchalupa/symbiotic
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../symbiotic/symbiotic-build.sh -j4

Result is to be in build/install directory and is under git control, so you
can see the differences between versions or make an archive using git archive
command.

If you need to specify paths to header files or libraries, you can do it
by passing CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS environment variables either by exporting
them beforehead, or by passing them as a make options.

Have fun! ;)
