What is Symbiotic?
======================

Symbiotic is a tool for verifying computer programs. It uses three well-know techniques -
instrumentation, slicing and symbolic execution. Symbiotic is highly modular,
so most of the components are in self-standing repository (see https://github.com/staticafi)

Building and running instructions can be found in the projects wiki: https://github.com/staticafi/symbiotic/wiki

Have fun! ;)
