Instrumentation (version 1)
===============================================

source | llvm [file name]
    insert after | before
          REGEXP
          TEXT
    insert beginning | end
          TEXT
    replace [function]
          REGEXP
          TEXT
    delete [function]
          REGEXP

source or llvm defines on what form of program will instrumentation
take action. Optionaly if [file name] is given, then the action will
be done only on file matching [file name] REGEXP. If no file is given,
then the action is run on all files.

insert after | before inserts TEXT after (before) lines that match the text.
insert beginning | end inserts TEXT at beginning (end) of file
replace replaces REGEXP with TEXT. If [function] is given, then the REGEXP is
supposed to be pattern of name of function and the whole function (with body
wich is not in REGEXP) will be replaced by text

delete works like replace with empty TEXT

REGEXP is regular expresion which can be preceded by these arguments:
        extended -- regular expresion is extended
        multiline -- regular expresion should match over new lines
TEXT is usual text (can be wrapped by ' or "). If the text starts with """ then it is
read over newlines until another """ is met. From each line will be removed indentation
that matches indentation level.

Actions are processed on files in the given order. For example in

delete
  key
replace
  key
  KEY

The replacement will have no effect.
Comments are in form # comment on separate line (preceded only by white space)


Example:
---------------

source .*\.c
  # insert declaration of do_something2() on the beginning of
  # each file
  insert beginning
    int do_something2(void); /* declaration of foo_function */

  # replace call to do_something() by do_something2()
  replace
    \(.*\)do_something()\(.*\)
    \1do_something2()\2

  # replace function do_something() by do_something2()
  replace function
    extended void|int do_something(void)

    """
    int do_something2(void)
    {
        abort();
    }
    """
